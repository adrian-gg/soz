# SOZ

In turns, each player must play one tile, from 1 to 8, following the numerical order. They can play the tile on top of the line or in a segment.

Once the board is full, the count is made. In each of the eight segments the value of the pieces of both players are added separately and subtracted from each other. The resulting total value of the winner of each segment is added to the other segments won by the same player. The winner is the one with the highest value.

Note: the final result will be displayed in base9.
